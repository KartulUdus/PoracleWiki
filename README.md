# Poracle Documentation

## Introduction

This project is meant to serve as a WIKI page source for [PoracleJS](https://github.com/KartulUdus/PoracleJS/).  

## Links

- [WIKI](https://muckelba.github.io/poracleWiki/) - Live version  
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/AathPCp) - Place to Discuss stuff   

## Install

Have a look at the official GitHub Documentation about a [local Jekyll environment](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)
After Jekyll has been installed make sure to install the required packages. This can be accomplished by running `bundle install`.
To run the server run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and you can access the running instance on `localhost:4000`. If you are running on WSL you will need to add the parameter `--host <IP_OF_WSL>`.
And when you are happy with your changes, commit them to your fork and open a PR against original.  


Many thanks
